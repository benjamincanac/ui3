## Usage

Wrap your app with this component in your `app.vue` to provide global configurations and enable features like toasts, tooltips, etc. as well as programmatic modals and slideovers.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <UApp>
    <NuxtPage />
  </UApp>
</template>
```

It's using Radix Vue's [ConfigProvider](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/config-provider.html) to provide global configuration to all components:

- Enables all primitives to inherit global reading direction.
- Enables changing the behavior of scroll body when setting body lock.
- Much more controls to prevent layout shifts.
